This is a simple java program that calculates the zeros of any quadratic function in the form ax^2+bx+c. The user inputs a b c in the terminal.

How to run this program on the terminal:

1.) Move into the directory that stores the .java and .class files

2.) Since the code is already compiled into a .class file, you do NOT need to run the javac command

3.) Simply type: //java AdvanceQuadratic a b c// into the terminal, substitute your a b and c value for the a b and c
