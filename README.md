This is a simple java program that calculates the zeros of any quadratic function in the form ax^2+bx+c. The user inputs a b c in the terminal.

How to run this program on the terminal:

1.) Move into the directory that stores the .java and .class files

2.) Since the code is already compiled into a .class file, you do NOT need to run the javac command

3.) Simply type: //java AdvanceQuadratic// into the terminal, and the program will prompt you for a, b , and c

4.)Once you are done with your calcuations the program will ask if you wish to exit. Enter Y/N to exit or redo the loop, respectively.
